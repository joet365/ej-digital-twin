# What is an AI Receptionist?

An AI receptionist is an automated software system that answers phone calls, captures caller information, books appointments, and transfers calls to your team. Unlike traditional voicemail, AI receptionists engage every caller professionally 24/7, ensuring no business opportunity is missed.

## How Does an AI Receptionist Work?

AI receptionists work in 3 simple steps:

1. **Answer Calls** - AI picks up every call instantly, no rings, no voicemail
2. **Engage Callers** - Natural conversation to understand caller needs and intent
3. **Take Action** - Book appointments, capture lead information, or transfer to your team

The system uses advanced natural language processing to understand caller intent, respond appropriately, and take the right action based on your business rules.

## What Are the Benefits of an AI Receptionist?

- **Never Miss a Call** - 24/7 availability, even after hours and weekends
